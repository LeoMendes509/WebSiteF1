🔗 [Live Demo](https://web-site-f1.vercel.app)

## Project Overview

This project is a clean, modern, and fully **responsive landing page** dedicated to legendary Formula 1 drivers and iconic moments in F1 history. Designed from scratch using **semantic HTML5**, **vanilla CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, it delivers a smooth bilingual experience (Portuguese & English) without relying on any frameworks.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Semantic HTML5 Structure:** Proper use of tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` for accessibility and SEO benefits.
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with flexible layouts that adapt flawlessly to all screen sizes.
- 🌐 **Bilingual Support:** Seamless language toggle powered by pure JavaScript and localStorage to remember user preferences.
- 🧹 **Clean & Maintainable Code:** Well-organized files, clear naming conventions, and modular JavaScript for easy scalability.
- ♿ **Accessibility Focus:** Alt attributes on images, good color contrast, keyboard navigable menus, and ARIA labels.
- 🚫 **No External Dependencies:** No libraries or frameworks — just solid front-end fundamentals.

## Development Approach

- ⚙️ Built the UI using **Flexbox and Media Queries** for advanced responsiveness.
- 🌍 Implemented a **custom internationalization (i18n) system**, mapping text keys to translations and dynamically updating the DOM.
- ⚡ Ensured **performance and UX** by minimizing layout shifts and enabling smooth transitions.
- 📈 Applied **best practices in web standards and SEO** to maximize reach and usability.
- 🗂️ Structured the project with separation of concerns: HTML, CSS, and JS in dedicated folders for clarity and maintainability.
